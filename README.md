# House-Price-Prediction

This project applies machine learning to predict housing prices across the U.S. using structured real estate data. Leveraging Random Forest Regression, I developed a robust model that achieves an average prediction error of just $81,258, or ~6.6% relative to the average home price.

From hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to rigorous error evaluation and feature scaling, this notebook showcases a full ML workflowâ€”including best practices for pipeline development, reproducibility, and model interpretation.
